# 1. Overview

## 1.1. The Challenge

Managing renewable energy assets in Italy involves navigating a complex web of bureaucratic requirements across multiple government agencies. Plant operators must interact with:

- **Terna** (GAUDÃŒ system) for grid connection and plant registration
- **GSE** (Energy Services Manager) for incentive management and conventions
- **DSO** (Distribution System Operators) for connection requests and technical compliance
- **Agenzia delle Dogane** (Customs Agency) for electric workshop licenses
- **Local Authorities** for permits and authorizations

Each interaction has strict deadlines, complex procedures, and severe penalties for non-compliance. Missing a single deadline can result in thousands of euros in fines or loss of incentives.

### 1.3.3. Component Descriptions

*   **Frontend**: A responsive single-page application (SPA) built with **React** and **TypeScript**. It leverages Material-UI for its component library and Tailwind CSS for styling. The application is fully internationalized with `i18next`.
*   **Backend**: A robust API built with **Python** and the **FastAPI** framework. It uses a **PostgreSQL** database for data storage, **Redis** for caching and task queuing, and **Qdrant** for vector search.
*   **Services**: The backend integrates with a number of services, including AI/ML services for intelligent document processing, voice services for audio transcription, and RPA for automating interactions with external portals.
