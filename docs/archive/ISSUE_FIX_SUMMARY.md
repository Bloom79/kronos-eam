# Issue Fix Summary

## Fixed Issues

### 1. Backend API Errors (500 Internal Server Error)
**Issue**: Dashboard and calendar endpoints were failing due to Italian attribute names
**Solution**: 
- Updated all model attribute references from Italian to English
- Fixed `PlantPerformance.anno` → `PlantPerformance.year`
- Fixed `PlantPerformance.mese` → `PlantPerformance.month`
- Fixed `Maintenance.stato` → `Maintenance.status`
- Fixed all other Italian attributes in dashboard.py and calendar.py
- Added proper enum imports and comparisons

### 2. React Router Warnings
**Issue**: Future flag warnings about v7_startTransition and v7_relativeSplatPath
**Solution**: 
- Kept the standard BrowserRouter implementation
- The warnings are informational about future React Router v7 changes
- No immediate action needed, warnings don't affect functionality

### 3. TypeScript Compilation Errors
**Issue**: Property name mismatches in PlantsTable.tsx
**Solution**:
- Fixed `plant.prossimaScadenza` → `plant.prossima_scadenza`
- Fixed `plant.coloreScadenza` → `plant.colore_scadenza`

### 4. ESLint Warnings
**Issue**: Multiple unused imports and variables
**Solution**:
- Fixed critical operator precedence issue in BrowserCrypto.ts
- Other warnings are non-critical and can be addressed later

## Remaining Non-Critical Issues

### ESLint Warnings (41 total)
These are mostly unused imports that don't affect functionality:
- Unused icon imports in various components
- Unused setter functions in state hooks
- Missing dependencies in useEffect hooks

### Recommendations
1. Run `npm run lint:fix` to auto-fix some ESLint issues
2. Manually review and remove unused imports
3. Add `// eslint-disable-next-line` for intentionally unused variables
4. Consider updating to React Router v7 when stable

## Application Status

- ✅ Frontend compiles without errors
- ✅ Authentication and authorization functioning
- ✅ Multi-language support operational
